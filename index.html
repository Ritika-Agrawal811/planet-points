              Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System and the closest
              to the Sun. Its orbit around the Sun takes 87.97 Earth days, the
              shortest of all the Sun's planets.Mercury rotates in a way that is
              unique in the Solar System.Its orbital eccentricity is the largest
              of all known planets in the Solar System.

              is the site of Olympus Mons, the largest volcano and highest known
              mountain on any planet in the Solar System. Mars has two moons,
              Phobos and Deimos, which are small and irregularly shaped.

              Jupiter is the third brightest natural object in the Earth's night

              than two and a half times that of all the other planets in the
              Solar System combined. There is a Great Red Spot, a giant storm
              known to have existed since at least the 17th century when
              telescopes first saw it.

              Sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar

              largest moon and the second largest in the Solar System, is larger
              than the planet Mercury, although less massive, and is the only
              moon in the Solar System to have a substantial atmosphere.

              Seventh planet from the Sun and has the third-largest diameter in

              slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus. Neptune is denser
              and physically smaller than Uranus because its greater mass causes
              more gravitational compression of its atmosphere. It is referred
              to as as one of the solar system's two ice giant planets.
