            <h4>PROTECTIVE SHIELD</h4>
            <p>
              Our atmosphere protects us from incoming meteoroids, most of which
              break up in our atmosphere before they can strike the surface.

            <h4>SQUASHED SPHERE</h4>
            <p>
              Earth is not a perfect sphere. As it spins, gravity points toward
              the center of our planet, and a centrifugal force pushes outward.
              But since this gravity-opposing force acts perpendicular to the
              axis of Earth, and Earth's axis is tilted, centrifugal force at
              the equator is not exactly opposed to gravity. This imbalance adds
              up at the equator, where gravity pushes extra masses of water and
              earth into a bulge.

            <h4>GRAVITY ISN'T UNIFORM</h4>
            <p>
              If Earth were a perfect sphere, its gravitational field would be
              the same everywhere. But in reality, the planet's surface is
              bumpy, and water flow, ice drift and the movement of the tectonic
              plates beneath Earth's crust all change the pull of gravity. These
              variations are known as gravity anomalies.

            <h4>EARTH USED TO BE PURPLE</h4>
            <p>
              Scientists believe that ancient microbes might have used a
              molecule other than chlorophyll to harness the sun's rays, one
              that gave the organisms a violet hue. It is believed that
              chlorophyll appeared after another light-sensitive molecule called
              retinal was already present on early Earth. Retinal absorbs green
              light and reflects back red and violet light, the combination of
              which appears purple.

            <h4>ONLY PLANET WITH TECTONIC PLATES</h4>
            <p>
              The outer crust of the Earth has multiple regions called tectonic
              plates. Beneath that is a magma interior which causes the plates
              to move, occasionally crashing into one another. As they collide
              and pull apart, magma bubbles up and creates fresh crust to form.

            <h4>EARTH IS RADIOACTIVE</h4>
            <p>
              In total, Earth generates as much as 40 terawatts of heat, half of
              which comes from radioactive decay in its core, according to a
              2011 study. Scientists measured particles called antineutrinos
              that streamed up from Earth's core and found that half of Earth's
              heat is generated through the radioactive decay of certain
              elements.

            <h4>DAYS ARE GETTING LONGER</h4>
            <p>
              The tides on Earth are strongest when Sun,Moon and Earth are in a
              line, which happens near full Moon and new Moon. Then the Earth is
              being stretched out along that line.This results in water moving
              in the oceans and rocks moving underground, both of which
              dissipate kinetic energy. The net result is that the Earth is
              spinning down — the day is getting longer.

              Scientists think that there is ice inside Mercury's craters. The
              planet's north and south poles are cold and shadowy, which could
              allow them to retain water ice. Meteorites and comets could have
              delivered ice to those areas, or water vapor from Mercury's
              innards could have seeped out and frozen.

            <p>
              Venus is often called "Earth’s twin" because they’re similar in
              size and structure, but Venus has extreme surface heat and a
              dense, toxic atmosphere. If the Sun were as tall as a typical
              front door, Earth and Venus would each be about the size of a
              nickel.

            <h4>LONG DAYS, SHORT YEARS</h4>
            <p>
              Venus rotates very slowly on its axis – one day on Venus lasts 243
              Earth days. The planet orbits the Sun faster than Earth, however,
              so one year on Venus takes only about 225 Earth days, making a
              Venusian day longer than its year!

              Venus’ thick atmosphere traps heat creating a runaway greenhouse

              surface temperatures hot enough to melt lead. The greenhouse
              effect makes Venus roughly 700°F (390°C) hotter than it would be
              without a greenhouse effect.

            <p>
              Venus is permanently shrouded in thick, toxic clouds of sulfuric
              acid that start at an altitude of 28 to 43 miles (45 to 70
              kilometers). The clouds smell like rotten eggs!

            <h4>SPACECRAFT MAGNET</h4>
            <p>
              Venus was the first planet explored by a spacecraft and was
              intensely studied early in the history of space exploration. Venus
              was also the first planet whose surface was reached by a
              spacecraft from Earth. The intense heat means landers have only
              survived for a couple of hours.

            <h4>LIFE ON VENUS</h4>
            <p>
              Venus is an unlikely place for life as we know it, but some
              scientists theorize microbes might exist high in the clouds where
              it’s cooler and the pressure is similar to Earth’s surface.
              Phosphine, a possible indicator of microbial life, has been
              observed in the clouds.

            <h4>BACKWARD SUNRISE</h4>
            <p>
              Venus rotates backward on its axis compared to most planets in our
              solar system. This means the Sun rises in the west and sets in the
              east, opposite of what we see on Earth.

            <h4>FASTEST PLANET</h4>
            <p>
              Mercury is the fastest planet in our solar system - traveling
              through space at nearly 29 miles (47 kilometers) per second. The
              closer a planet is to the Sun, the faster it travels. Since
              Mercury is the fastest planet and has the shortest distance to
              travel around the Sun, it has the shortest year of all the planets
              in our solar system - 88 days.

            <h4>ROUGH SURFACE</h4>
            <p>
              Mercury is a rocky planet, also known as a terrestrial planet.
              Mercury has a solid, cratered surface, much like the Earth's moon.

              Mercury's thin atmosphere, or exosphere, is composed mostly of

              potassium (K).

              Standing on Mercury's surface at its closest approach to the Sun,
              our star would appear more than three times larger than it does on
              Earth.

              Two NASA missions have explored Mercury: Mariner 10 was the first
              to fly by Mercury, and MESSENGER was the first to orbit. ESA's
              BepiColombo is on its way to Mercury.

            <h4>EXTREME TEMPERATURE</h4>
            <p>
              Even though Mercury is the closest planet to the sun, its surface
              can still be extremely cold. The temperature during the day can
              reach 840 degrees Fahrenheit (450 degrees Celsius), but at night,
              temperatures can get as low as minus 275 F (minus 170 C). That
              fluctuation equals a temperature swing of more than 1,100 F (600
              C), the largest of any planet in the solar system.

            <h4>HUGE IRON CORE</h4>
            <p>
              Mercury's iron core takes up about 75 percent of the planet's
              radius. The huge core has more iron in it than any other planet's
              in the solar system. Scientists aren't exactly sure how Mercury's
              giant iron core formed, but researchers think it has something to
              do with its formation. If the planet formed quickly, it could have
              left a thin shell of crust over the relatively large core.

            <h4>MERCURY HAS ICE</h4>
            <p>
              Scientists think that there is ice inside Mercury's craters. The
              planet's north and south poles are cold and shadowy, which could
              allow them to retain water ice. Meteorites and comets could have
              delivered ice to those areas, or water vapor from Mercury's
              innards could have seeped out and frozen.
