                The energy created by the Sun’s core is nuclear fusion. This

                has enough left to continue burning hydrogen for another 5
                billion years. Currently the Sun is a yellow dwarf star.

                The Sun has a powerful magnetic field. When magnetic energy is
                released by the Sun during magnetic storms, solar flares occur
                which we see on Earth as sunspots. Sunspots are dark areas on
                the Sun’s surface caused by magnetic variations. The reason they
                appear dark is due to their temperature being much lower than
                surrounding areas.

                After the Earth, Mercury is the second densest planet. Despite

                Mercury is named after the messenger of the Roman gods, who is
                also known as Hermes in Greek mythology. This is because of the
                speed in which Mercury orbits the Sun and the speed with which

                It was once believed that a planet called Vulcan existed between

                Mercury is the only planet which doesn’t rotate exactly once
                every year – instead rotating three times for every two orbits

                One day on Venus is longer than one year. Due to the slow
                rotation on its axis, it takes 243 Earth-days to complete one
                rotation. The orbit of the planet takes 225 Earth-days – making

                The temperature on Venus doesn’t vary much between the night and
                day. This is due to the slow movement of the solar winds across

                Venus has a very weak magnetic field. This surprised scientists,
                who expected Venus to have a magnetic field similar in strength
                to Earth’s. One possible reason for this is that Venus has no
                solid inner core, or that its core is not cooling.

            <h4>SQUASHED SPHERE</h4>
            <p>
              Earth is not a perfect sphere. As it spins, gravity points toward
              the center of our planet, and a centrifugal force pushes outward.
              But since this gravity-opposing force acts perpendicular to the
              axis of Earth, and Earth's axis is tilted, centrifugal force at
              the equator is not exactly opposed to gravity. This imbalance adds
              up at the equator, where gravity pushes extra masses of water and
              earth into a bulge.

              If Earth were a perfect sphere, its gravitational field would be
              the same everywhere. But in reality, the planet's surface is
              bumpy, and water flow, ice drift and the movement of the tectonic
              plates beneath Earth's crust all change the pull of gravity. These
              variations are known as gravity anomalies.

              Scientists believe that ancient microbes might have used a

              chlorophyll appeared after another light-sensitive molecule called
              retinal was already present on early Earth. Retinal absorbs green
              light and reflects back red and violet light, the combination of
              which appears purple.

              to move, occasionally crashing into one another. As they collide
              and pull apart, magma bubbles up and creates fresh crust to form.

              which comes from radioactive decay in its core, according to a
              2011 study. Scientists measured particles called antineutrinos

            <h4>DAYS ARE GETTING LONGER</h4>
            <p>
              The tides on Earth are strongest when Sun,Moon and Earth are in a
              line, which happens near full Moon and new Moon. Then the Earth is
              being stretched out along that line.This results in water moving
              in the oceans and rocks moving underground, both of which
              dissipate kinetic energy. The net result is that the Earth is
              spinning down — the day is getting longer.

            <p>
              Scientists think that there is ice inside Mercury's craters. The
              planet's north and south poles are cold and shadowy, which could
              allow them to retain water ice. Meteorites and comets could have
              delivered ice to those areas, or water vapor from Mercury's
              innards could have seeped out and frozen.

            <h4>TOXIC TWIN</h4>
            <p>
              Venus is often called "Earth’s twin" because they’re similar in
              size and structure, but Venus has extreme surface heat and a
              dense, toxic atmosphere. If the Sun were as tall as a typical
              front door, Earth and Venus would each be about the size of a
              nickel.

            <h4>LONG DAYS, SHORT YEARS</h4>
            <p>
              Venus rotates very slowly on its axis – one day on Venus lasts 243
              Earth days. The planet orbits the Sun faster than Earth, however,
              so one year on Venus takes only about 225 Earth days, making a
              Venusian day longer than its year!

            <h4>RUNAWAY GREENHOUSE</h4>
            <p>
              Venus’ thick atmosphere traps heat creating a runaway greenhouse
              effect – making it the hottest planet in our solar system with
              surface temperatures hot enough to melt lead. The greenhouse
              effect makes Venus roughly 700°F (390°C) hotter than it would be
              without a greenhouse effect.

              Venus was the first planet explored by a spacecraft and was
              intensely studied early in the history of space exploration. Venus
              was also the first planet whose surface was reached by a
              spacecraft from Earth. The intense heat means landers have only
              survived for a couple of hours.

            <p>
              Venus is an unlikely place for life as we know it, but some
              scientists theorize microbes might exist high in the clouds where
              it’s cooler and the pressure is similar to Earth’s surface.
              Phosphine, a possible indicator of microbial life, has been
              observed in the clouds.

            <p>
              Venus rotates backward on its axis compared to most planets in our
              solar system. This means the Sun rises in the west and sets in the
              east, opposite of what we see on Earth.

            <h4>FASTEST PLANET</h4>
            <p>
              Mercury is the fastest planet in our solar system - traveling
              through space at nearly 29 miles (47 kilometers) per second. The
              closer a planet is to the Sun, the faster it travels. Since
              Mercury is the fastest planet and has the shortest distance to
              travel around the Sun, it has the shortest year of all the planets
              in our solar system - 88 days.

              Even though Mercury is the closest planet to the sun, its surface
              can still be extremely cold. The temperature during the day can
              reach 840 degrees Fahrenheit (450 degrees Celsius), but at night,
              temperatures can get as low as minus 275 F (minus 170 C). That
              fluctuation equals a temperature swing of more than 1,100 F (600
              C), the largest of any planet in the solar system.

              Mercury's iron core takes up about 75 percent of the planet's
              radius. The huge core has more iron in it than any other planet's
              in the solar system. Scientists aren't exactly sure how Mercury's
              giant iron core formed, but researchers think it has something to
              do with its formation. If the planet formed quickly, it could have
              left a thin shell of crust over the relatively large core.
