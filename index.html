              Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System and the closest
              to the Sun. Its orbit around the Sun takes 87.97 Earth days, the
              shortest of all the Sun's planets.Mercury rotates in a way that is
              unique in the Solar System.Its orbital eccentricity is the largest
              of all known planets in the Solar System.

          <h4>FASTEST PLANET</h4>
          <p>
            Mercury is the fastest planet in our solar system U+2013 traveling
            through space at nearly 29 miles (47 kilometers) per second. The
            closer a planet is to the Sun, the faster it travels. Since Mercury
            is the fastest planet and has the shortest distance to travel around
            the Sun, it has the shortest year of all the planets in our solar
            system U+2013 88 days.

          <h4>ROUGH SURFACE</h4>
          <p>
            Mercury is a rocky planet, also known as a terrestrial planet.
            Mercury has a solid, cratered surface, much like the Earth's moon.

          <h4>THIN ATMOSPHERE</h4>
          <p>
            Mercury's thin atmosphere, or exosphere, is composed mostly of
            oxygen (O2), sodium (Na), hydrogen (H2), helium (He), and potassium
            (K).

          <h4>BIG SUN</h4>
          <p>
            Standing on Mercury's surface at its closest approach to the Sun,
            our star would appear more than three times larger than it does on
            Earth.

          <h4>ROBOTIC VISITORS</h4>
          <p>
            Two NASA missions have explored Mercury: Mariner 10 was the first to
            fly by Mercury, and MESSENGER was the first to orbit. ESA's
            BepiColombo is on its way to Mercury.

          <h4>EXTREME TEMPERATURE</h4>
          <p>
            Even though Mercury is the closest planet to the sun, its surface
            can still be extremely cold. The temperature during the day can
            reach 840 degrees Fahrenheit (450 degrees Celsius), but at night,
            temperatures can get as low as minus 275 F (minus 170 C). That
            fluctuation equals a temperature swing of more than 1,100 F (600 C),
            the largest of any planet in the solar system.

          <h4>HUGE IRON CORE</h4>
          <p>
            Mercury's iron core takes up about 75 percent of the planet's
            radius. The huge core has more iron in it than any other planet's in
            the solar system. Scientists aren't exactly sure how Mercury's giant
            iron core formed, but researchers think it has something to do with
            its formation. If the planet formed quickly, it could have left a
            thin shell of crust over the relatively large core.

          <h4>MERCURY HAS ICE</h4>
          <p>
            Scientists think that there is ice inside Mercury's craters. The
            planet's north and south poles are cold and shadowy, which could
            allow them to retain water ice. Meteorites and comets could have
            delivered ice to those areas, or water vapor from Mercury's innards
            could have seeped out and frozen.
